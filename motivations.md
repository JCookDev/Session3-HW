What's motivating me to change career?
My "why" is motivating me to get into tech. The world is becoming a place where
technology is integrated into almost everything we do. I want to be one of the
people who deeply understands the pivotal role technology is playing in our
daily lives. I want to go down in history as an engineer of technological
innovation!
